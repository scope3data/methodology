The difference between fixed monthly BB traffic compared to mobile BB one is reasonable, since fixed connections do not have a metered charge (a flat rate data charge is included in the final price). On the other hand, most of the mobile programs do not offer unlimited data volume as in the case of fixed programs, which leads subscribers to make rational use of their mobile phone, related more to navigation and use of applications (mobile apps) . In addition, much of the traffic from mobile devices is done via WiFi networks, and thus, it is counted in the traffic of fixed networks.
