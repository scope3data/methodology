# Channel-Specific Modeling Considerations

Different advertising channels require specific modeling approaches due to their unique infrastructure, operational characteristics, and consumption patterns. This document details the methodology considerations for Linear TV, Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH), and Classic Out-of-Home (OOH). While these channels share some common principles, each has distinct lifecycle boundaries, data requirements, and default assumptions that reflect the nature of their delivery and usage.

# Linear TV

## Definition and Scope

We classify Linear TV as content that is transmitted via traditional broadcast methods and follows a predetermined programming schedule.

## Emissions Calculation Methodology

### Corporate Emissions

For Linear TV, we estimate corporate emissions per TV spot rather than per audience or household impression. We do this to avoid having differing numbers depending on fluctuating TV ratings.
All other aspects of our calculations for corporate emissions remain as described in [Corporate Emissions](./corporate_model).

### Broadcast Signal Emissions

#### Encoding & Multiplexing

In [_A comparison of the carbon footprint of digital terrestrial television with video-on-demand_](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP189.pdf) the BBC estimated that their encoding & multiplexing facility required a power draw of 400kW to encode TV content for their 24 channels.

We use this estimate to derive that it takes an average power draw of 16.7kW to encode and multiplex TV content for one channel (no matter the number of viewing households). For TV networks and/or channels where actual power usage data is available, we use those values instead of the average.

#### Signal Transmission

##### Energy Use

For each TV broadcast method we consider a fixed energy consumption required to broadcast the signal no matter the number of viewing households.

Different TV broadcast methods have varying power efficiency in different countries but for now we do not differentiate between countries.

For each TV broadcast method we have derived power draw estimates from annual energy consumption, either from primary sourced energy consumption data shared with Scope3 by network operators or from the BBC paper.

| TV Broadcast Method | Energy consuming sources                               | Required Power for signal transmission of 1 TV channel | Source(s)                     | Assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OTA/DTT             | Over the air transmission network                      | 165 kW                                                 | Terrestrial Network operators | - National distribution                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Cable               | Cable network                                          | 16 kW                                                  | BBC paper                     | - TV represents 53% of cable network usage<br/>- The Virgin Media cable network provider in the UK hosts 400 channels.                                                                         |
| Satellite           | Uplink transmission from TV station tower to satellite | 3.15kW                                                 | BBC paper                     | - No emissions coming from downlink transmission from space satellite to household dishes (satellites being powered by the sun)<br/>- Assuming equal energy usage across all BBC's 24 channels |

Once again, for TV networks and/or channels where actual power usage data is available, we use those values instead of the above defaults.

##### Embodied Emissions

In the absence of data specific to each TV broadcast method, we utilize our estimates of the embodied emissions as the fixed Internet network (0.00000443 gCO2e per kb) to derive the embodied emissions of each broadcast method per second, assuming 6Mbps per transmitter per channel, across 1000 transmitters.

```equation
embodied_emissions_gco2e_per_second = 0.00000443 gCO2e/kb * 1000 transmitters * 6000 kbps/channel = 27 gCO2e/second/channel
```

#### Broadcast Method Usage

The prevalence of each TV broadcast method varies by TV network and geographically. For example, in France OTA/DTT and IPTV are the most widely used broadcast methods in terms of households, whereas in Germany satellite is the most prevalent method. We apply a country-specific ratio of broadcast methods for major markets, and use a global average for other countries.

| Country         | % of households using OTA/DTT | % of households using cable | % of households using satellite | % of households using IPTV |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |

### Household Equipment Emissions

#### Energy Consumption

We consider some household equipment "passive", meaning that they do not require any power to receive the broadcast signal, and others "active".

| Component                           | Broadcasting Method(s)  | Global % of household with that equipment for that broadcast method | Active or Passive | Estimated Power Draw | Source(s)                                            |

#### Embodied Emissions

Similarly to how we model consumer devices (see [Consumer Devices](./consumer_devices)), we estimate _Production Energy per Use Second_ (PEPS) for each and every piece of household equipment.

| Component                           | Broadcasting Method(s)  | Global % of household with that equipment for that broadcast method | Equipment use Allocation % for Linear TV | Lifetime Impact kgCO2e (excluding use) | Usage (h/day) | Years in use | PEPS (gCO2e/s) | Mass (grams) | Example Unit                                 |

### TV Viewing Emissions

We follow the same methodology as described in [Consumer Devices](./consumer_devices), accounting for both use phase (energy consumption) and embodied emission (production & disposal).

We adapt the "synthetic TV system" for Linear TV accordingly:

- Set-top boxes (STBs) and decoders are excluded, as they are already accounted for under household equipment.
- We retain the assumption from Urban et al. that 7% of televisions come with a sound bar.

This results in the following TV system:

| Device                | Power (W) | PEPS (gCO2e/s) |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| TV System (Linear TV) | 75        | 0.0096         |

### Estimating the number of TV impressions

We estimate the number of TV devices reached using a co-viewing factor of 1.5, in line with published audience measurement benchmarks across major markets. This means that for every 1.5 audience impressions, we assume one TV device was used to view the content.
Example:

- Input: 1,000,000 audience impressions for a TV spot
- Device count estimate: 1,000,000 ÷ 1.5 = 666,667 TV devices

# Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH)

## Definition and Scope

Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) refers to digital displays used for advertising in public spaces, such as billboards, transit displays, and retail screens. Unlike Linear TV, DOOH screens are owned or leased by media owners who have direct control over their operation and maintenance.

## Boundaries of Measurement

DOOH screens, like consumer devices, require energy to display an ad. Energy consumption during the use phase is in fact the highest source of emissions.
However, on the contrary to consumer devices, billboards are owned or leased by media owners who therefore have a high level of operational control over the screen attributes that influence embodied and energy related emissions (venue category, manufacturer, model, size, location and positioning, operating hours, brightness settings etc...). For that reason, we are including emissions from screens' energy usage and production to "media distribution".

| Emissions source            | Lifecycle category    | Status           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Screens' embodied emissions | Media Distribution    | In-development   |
| Screens' energy consumption | Media Distribution    | Included         |
| Corporate emissions         | Media Distribution    | Included         |
| Use of Ad Technology        | Ad Selection          | In-development   |
| Creative data transfers     | Creative Distribution | Included         |
| Screens' recycling/disposal | Disposal              | To be considered |

## Emissions Calculation Methodology

### Screen Emissions

#### Embodied Emissions

Coming soon

#### Energy Consumption

On the contrary to [consumer device emissions](./consumer_devices), we have found no credible research paper describing the power draw of large digital billboards. As such, we estimate for individual screens based on a variety of input data sources (listed in order from most accurate to least accurate):

- Electricity metres installed on the screens themselves and monitoring power draw in near real-time.
- Power bills received by media owners on a monthly, quaterly or yearly basis, for a group of or for individual screens.
- Technical specifications from screen manufacturers like Daktronics, Samsung or Panasonic. We have found that these often document maximum power draw (instead of average power draw), which can lead to an over-estimation of energy consumption.
- Extrapolation based on physical dimensions and one of the above data point for screens from the same media owner.
- Extrapolation based on physical dimensions and venue type, off the back of data for 500k+ screens kindly provided to us by early partners (including DOOH programmatic platform Hivestack and DOOH media owners JCDecaux ANZ, Go Media and Lumo).

When no screen attribute or energy data is available to us for a given screen, we estimate the power draw of that screen to be "the 80th percentile" amongst screens that media owner and/or venue category and/or country (based on statistical relevance). This approach aims to incentivize more media owners to share power draw data with us and the wider advertising industry.

### Corporate Emissions

See [Corporate Emissions](./corporate_model)

### Ad Selection Emissions

Unlike other digital channels, DOOH lacks a standard such as ads.txt that enables media owners to disclose the vendors involved in their monetization waterfall. This makes [mapping the ad tech graph](./publisher_model#mapping-the-ad-tech-graph) more challenging.
We encourage DOOH media owners to share this information with us via [Ad Stack Declaration](https://docs.scope3.com/docs/ad-stack-declaration). Where no declared data is available, and after consultation with the media owner, we assume the presence of one ad server and five SSPs called by that ad server for each ad request.

### Creative Data Transfer Emissions

See [Emissions from Data Transfer](./data_transfer)

## Additional Considerations

### Impression Multiplier

One key difference between the digital out-of-home channel and others is its one-to-many nature, meaning that most likely one ad play can be viewed by multiple individuals around the screen.
For this reason, our modelling is done "per play" and translated to "per impression" through the use of a screen specific average impression multiplier provided by partners (media owners and platforms).

When no impression multiplier data is provided to us for a given screen, we once again estimate that value to be the 80th percentile amongst screens that media owner and/or venue category and/or country (based on statistical relevance).

# Classic Out-Of-Home

## Definition and Scope

Classic OOH includes outdoor advertising displayed on non-digital panels such as posters, billboards, and transit wraps. Unlike DOOH, these formats rely on physical assets printed on paper, vinyl, or similar materials and mounted on a fixed structure. This category excludes print media such as magazines or newspapers. In our data model, the primary object representing inventory is the panel (sometimes called a “frame” in certain markets), which describes the physical structure where ads are displayed. For this channel, emissions come from tangible processes like material extraction, printing, transportation, installation, and disposal — introducing lifecycle considerations unique to physical media..

Transient OOH advertising - displayed on moving vehicles such as buses, taxis, or trains — is also covered under this model when the vehicle’s primary purpose is not advertising.

## Measurement Boundaries & GMSF Alignment

Our classic OOH model aligns closely with the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF) and introduces lifecycle categories that reflect the physical nature of this channel. Unlike digital media, classic OOH requires consideration of ad production, logistics, and end-of-life treatment of physical assets.

The model aligns with GMSF and covers the following categories:
| Emissions source | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display structure | Amortized emissions from manufacturing the supporting structure over its expected lifetime.|
| Creation | Emissions from printing the advertisement and, where relevant, producing materials used for display.|
| Distribution | Transportation and storage of physical assets prior to installation.|
| Operations | Energy consumption for illumination and mechanical rotation during the display period.|
| Disposal | Emissions from transporting and processing ad materials and structures at the end of their use, including recycling or landfill.|
| Corporate emissions | Corporate emissions from the media owner.|

## Emissions Calculation Methodology

Emissions for classic OOH are calculated using a combination of panel-level data (when available) and venue-type or country-level averages as fallback. We allocate emissions across lifecycle categories using campaign duration and share of time on each panel. Where detailed attributes such as size, illumination, or transportation distances are provided, calculations are more precise.

### Panel Object

To support granular measurement, classic OOH introduces a panel object (similar to the “screen” object used for DOOH). A panel represents the physical structure where ads are displayed and carries attributes relevant for emissions estimation:

| Attributes                                 | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Panel Identifier                           | Identifier of the panel, provided by the media owner                                               |
| Media Owner                                | Name of the organization that owns the panel                                                       |
| Country / Region / Postcode                | Location of the panel.                                                                             |
| Physical Width / Physical Height           | Dimensions of the panel in centimeters.                                                            |
| Average Daily Contacts                     | Average number of people exposed to the ad per day (if available).                                 |
| Expected Lifetime Years                    | Expected lifetime of the panel for amortizing embodied emissions.                                  |
| Average Daily Illumination Hours           | Average daily hours of illumination.                                                               |
| Illumination Power Draw                    | Power draw (in watts) for illumination.                                                            |
| Energy Consumption Per Mechanical Rotation | Energy required for a single mechanical rotation (if applicable).                                  |
| Mechanical Rotations Per Day               | Average number of rotations per day (if applicable).                                               |
| Average Structure Production Emissions     | Total embodied emissions of the display structure (if available), excluding end of life emissions. |
| Average Ad Production Emissions            | Emissions from ad asset production (if printed by media owner).                                    |
| Recycling Percentage of Structure          | Percentage of the structure expected to be recycled at end of life.                                |
| Recycling Percentage of Ad                 | Percentage of the ad expected to be recycled at end of life.                                       |

| distance attributes | Distances for logistics: printing → storage, storage → panel, panel → disposal. |

The accuracy of emissions estimates for classic OOH depends on the granularity of data provided. The most precise results come from panel-level data shared by media owners, including physical dimensions, energy use, and distances for installation and disposal. Where this information is not available, we apply venue-type and country-level averages derived from industry benchmarks and Scope3 research.

If panel-level data is unavailable, we apply venue-type averages by country, then global defaults. These defaults evolve as more partners share verified data.

### Possible Improvements

This is the first version of our classic OOH emissions model, and we expect it to evolve as better data and industry standards emerge. Key areas of focus for future iterations could include:

- Refined recycling modeling: incorporating more accurate data on recycling rates and emissions from different end-of-life scenarios for both ad materials and structures.
- Material-specific defaults: differentiating production and disposal impacts based on material type (e.g., paper vs. vinyl).
- Transport mode-specific defaults: Accounting for the type of vehicles used during installation and disposal logistics, including differences between electric, hybrid, and fuel-powered fleets.
- Regionalized defaults: applying localized emission factors for printing, storage, and disposal processes, reflecting regional infrastructure and grid intensity.
- Integration with industry data: leveraging data shared by media owners and OOH associations to replace assumptions with verified inputs.
