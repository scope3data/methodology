## Standards

A trusted publisher:

- Is responsible for the creation or distribution of all content on its properties (including user-generated content), and only works with content syndication partners that are trusted publishers
- Has an editorial or moderation policy
- Is listed publicly as the publisher on all of its properties
- Has executive leaders or owners who have history of adhering to best practices
- Does not acquire traffic from low-quality sources
- Has relationships with agencies and advertisers
- Uses industry best practices for implementing ad tech, including proper use of consent management platforms
- Does not allow copyrighted, pirated, or inappropriate content

## Verification Process

1. Validate KYC documents at least annually
2. Monitor publisher properties for policy violations, using third parties where applicable

## Accountability

A publisher that violates our standards will be removed from the trusted publisher list until they can conclusively demonstrate that they have fundamentally changed their processes, including terminating employees or contractors responsible for the violation.
