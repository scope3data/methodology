title: Trusted Supply Chains
---

Thinking of brand safety as a classification problem is only seeing part of the system. Especially in the programmatic context, multiple intermediaries may touch a bid request between the page render and the DSP or advertiser ad server. Each intermediary has a financial incentive to misrepresent low-quality or invalid inventory, creating the original need for a third-party verification layer that sits outside the transaction.

The alternative approach is to have a trusted supply chain where there are few intermediaries, if any, and these intermediaries adhere to high standards for accurately representing the underlying content. Given the high level of duplication and redundancy in the programmatic ecosystem, there is no risk to reach or scale by routing all bid requests through trusted partners.
