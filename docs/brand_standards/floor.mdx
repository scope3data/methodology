title: Universal Brand Safety Floor
---

A brand safety floor should exclude content that the vast majority of advertisers would not want adjacent to their advertising. This includes all illegal content (which may be country-specific or category-specific).

The Universal Floor uses the GARM standard as a foundation but removes a few categories like "Debated sensitive social issues" that were heavily subjective, and more clearly sets the standard at illegal, dangerous, or obscene.
