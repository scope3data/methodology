## Universal brand safety; bespoke brand suitability

One of the failures of the GARM process was the failure to distinguish between content that is not safe for _any_ brand (in other words, universally unsafe) and content that some brands might feel was inappropriate for their values or audience.

Our approach draws a clear distinction between a [universal brand safety floor](./floor) and brand-defined standards. This ensures that by default, brands maximize reach and publisher maximize monetization potential. Any choices by the brand to exclude content should be put in context of the potential impact to reach.

## Transparency

Advertisers should have full visibility into where their advertising appears. Publishers and platforms should know which content their advertisers consider not to meet their standards. Independent groups, for instance researchers, journalists, or non-profits, should be able to see universal floor decisions to ensure that the standard is being applied correctly.

All processes should be clearly documented for public feedback and potential inclusion in industry standards.

## Inclusive process with advertiser precedence

All stakeholders should have a voice in the brand safety and suitability conversation: advertisers, publishers, platforms, agencies, ad tech companies, policymakers, and the general public. That said, as long as all legal standards are met, the advertiser has the final say as to where they want to advertise.

## Collaboration not verification

Legitimate publishers and platforms want to satisfy their advertisers. They invest significant resources in editorial processes, moderation, and content analysis to prevent ads from running on inappropriate content. The goal of this spec is to help publishers and advertisers work together to put the right ads in the right placements. This requires trust and verification, or as they say in poker, "trust everyone, but cut the cards."
