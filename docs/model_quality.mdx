To effectively understand how accurate an emissions "measurement" is, given the many layers of assumptions and allocations involved in the calculation, is critical both for assessing provider quality and as a gating factor to incorporate data into corporate and regulatory reporting.

## Model Quality Components

Each modeled request should include:
- Grid mix model quality (1-5)
- Organization model quality (1-5) 
- Property model quality (1-5)
- Ad stack / ad platform quality (1-5)
- Input granularity score (1-5)

## Grid mix

Grid intensity can fluctuate significantly on an hourly basis due to the variable nature of both renewable energy sources (sun, wind) and electricity demand. To achieve effective decarbonization, having hourly data is critical. However, this isn't broadly available in many countries.

| Data source and timescale  | Model Quality  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Worldwide                  | 1              |
| Country, monthly or annual | 2              |
| Country, daily             | 3              |
| Country + region, daily    | 4              |
| Country + region, hourly   | 5              |

## Organization

Criteria for accurate sustainability data at the organization level:

* An organization should provide a sustainability report that details its full carbon footprint, including scopes 1, 2, and all scope 3 categories. This report should clearly detail methodology for each category.

* Any adjustments to the calculations for RECs, PPAs, offsets, or carbon credits should detail exactly what was purchased, from whom, and on what timeframe. Location-based scope 2 data should always be provided.

* A sustainability report should be published within 6 months of the end of the previous calendar year to be considered for sustainability purposes.

| Scope 1 and 2       | Scope 3         | Line of business | Model Quality |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| No recent report    | N/a             | N/a              | 1             |
| Incomplete coverage | N/a             | N/a              | 1             |
| Market-based        | None or partial | N/a              | 2             |
| Location-based      | None or partial | N/a              | 3             |
| Location-based      | Complete        | Not broken out   | 4             |
| Location-based      | Complete        | Broken out       | 5             |

## Ad Platform

An ad platform should provide 1) requests received, 2) requests sent (traffic shaping), and 3) emissions data from datacenters or cloud providers

| Server emissions | Request data | Frequency | Model Quality |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Not provided     | Not provided | N/a       | 1             |
| Global           | Global       | Annual    | 2             |
| Regional         | Regional     | Annual    | 3             |
| Global           | Global       | Monthly   | 4             |
| Regional         | Regional     | Monthly   | 5             |

## Property

For media properties, key metrics include session time, session weight, and ad load. For OOH screens, the key metric is power draw. A measured metric is acquired on a per-property basis - for instance, using Google Analytics on a website or a power meter on a screen. An estimated or average metric uses a third-party source or historical averages to project key metrics, for instance, using screen size and type to model power usage.

| Property Metrics              | Geography | Model Quality   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Not available                 | N/a         | 1             |
| Spend-based                   | N/a         | 2             |
| Average or estimated activity | Global      | 3             |
| Observed or measured activity | Global      | 4             |
| Observed or measured activity | Regional    | 5             |

## Ad Stack

The accuracy of the ad stack used by the publisher for the placement depends on accurate representation of all direct and indirect vendors. The ad stack score starts at 1 and increments based on modeled components.

| Ad Stack Component                        | Model Quality |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| All direct vendors identified             | +1            |
| All indirect vendors identified           | +1            |
| 90% of direct vendors have quality > 1    | +1            |
| 90% of direct vendors have quality > 3    | +1            |

## Input granularity

Provided inputs must match the underlying model in order to provide accurate output. For instance, if the user provides "ANZ" as a country, that might not match "AU" or "NZ", causing a mapping issue that could cause a fallback to using worldwide grid mix and a significant loss of accuracy.

Granularity % is the percentage of recommended input fields that are provided and match valid values.
