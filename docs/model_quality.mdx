# Model Quality (WIP)

To effectively understand how accurate an emissions "measurement" is, given the many layers of assumptions and allocations involved in the calculation, is critical both for assessing provider quality and as a gating factor to incorporate data into corporate and regulatory reporting.

We propose a multi-layer framework for quantifying accuracy with the objective of assessing whether the data is accurate enough for reporting purposes and for effective decarbonization.

1. Grid intensity. How granular and up to date is the data used?
2. Exposure data. Is there sufficient detail about the exposure to determine the delivered creative, the consumer device and network, the property and placement, the ad tech stack and supply chain, and the time of delivery?
3. Creative. Are there details about all assets used by the creative and all vendors that are involved in delivery and tracking?
4. Property data. Are there details about the ad stack and ad formats used by the publisher? Property metrics like session weight? The physical characteristics of the screen (in case of OOH)?
5. Intermediaries. Which intermediaries were involved in selecting or bidding on the impression? Is there data on how they distribute traffic to bidders and real-time data providers?
6. Market data. Are they based on recent data (and/or extrapolated to reflect trends)? Are they adjusted for market differences? Are they based on published research or replicable surveys?

## Grid intensity

Grid intensity can fluctuate significantly on an hourly basis due to the variable nature of both renewable energy sources (sun, wind) and electricity demand. To achieve effective decarbonization, having hourly data is critical. However, this isn't broadly available in many countries.
